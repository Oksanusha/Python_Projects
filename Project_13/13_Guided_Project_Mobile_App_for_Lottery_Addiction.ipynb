    "\n",
    "This project is about helping lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want to focus on the 6/49 lottery. My goal is to build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n",
